You need to make extensive edits to a complex Bash script and want features like syntax 
highlighting and code completion to reduce errors. Discuss the differences between vi and 
vim, and explain why you might choose vim over vi for this particular editing session. 
Mention how these differences can affect speed and accuracy in a real-world configuration 
task. 

Explanation:
    The main differnce between vi and vim lies in their features. Vim (Vi IMproved) enhances
    the functionality of vi with features like syntax highlighing, code completion, and an 
    undo tree. These additions make Vim a better choice for editing complex Bash scripts. 
    Syntax highlighing helps identify errors like unmatched quotes or braces, while code 
    completion speeds up coding by reducing typos. The undo tree allows effecient correction
    mistakes. These features improve accuracy and reduce the time required for real-world
    configuration tasks, where precision and speed are crucial.
