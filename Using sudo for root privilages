You need to apply a security patch to the system, but the patch installer requires root 
privileges. You currently have a non-privileged user account. Explain how you would use 
sudo to run the patch command with elevated privileges. Also, contrast using sudo versus 
su - in terms of security, auditability, and best practices.

Steps: 

1. Ensure your user is in the sudoers group by checking with groups <username>.
    command : groups <username>

2. run patch installer 
    command : sudo <patch_command>
    
Explanation
    a. unlike su -, sudo provides temporary privilege escalation for a specific 
      command, improving security by limiting full root access and enabling command 
      auditability in logs, which aligns with best practices for minimizing risks.
