A coworker claims that the file server_status.sh would be somewhere under /opt/scripts/ 
but neither of you can remember its last location. Explain how you would use the find 
command to locat this file. What options would you include to ensure that the search 
runs effieciently, and how would you interpret the results to navigate to the found 
file's directory?
