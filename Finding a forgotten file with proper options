A coworker claims that the file server_status.sh would be somewhere under /opt/scripts/ 
but neither of you can remember its last location. Explain how you would use the find 
command to locat this file. What options would you include to ensure that the search 
runs effieciently, and how would you interpret the results to navigate to the found 
file's directory?

Steps

1. Locate the file 
    command : find /opt/scripts/ -type f - name "server_status.sh"

Explanation:
    /opt/scripts/ as the directory to search.
    -type f to limit the search files
    -name "server_status.sh" to match the file name exactly.

For efficiency:
    Add -maxdepth to limit the recursion depth
    Use -iname for case-insensitive searches
    Use -exec to process results, e.g., print paths or navigate directly. 
    Interpret the output as absolute paths to locate and navigate to the directory 
    using cd or ls.
