Your team has a shared directory /reports on a production server, and all team members 
need the ability to read and write files in it. Currently, only the owner can write to
this directory. Explain how you would use chmod with either symbolic (e.g., u,g,o,+,-)
or numeric modes(e.g., 775) to ensure that the owner and group have write permissions,
while others can only read. Show the exact commands and verify the changes using ls -l.

1. Ensure the owner and group have write permissions while others can only read
    command : chmod 775 /reports

2. Verify changes 
    command : ls -ld /reports

  0 - no permissions 
  1 - only execute
  2 - only write
  3 - write and execute 
  4 - only read 
  5 - read and execute
  6 - read and write
  7 - read, write, and execute

  uga

  u - user
  g - group
  a - all (others)

  Explanation:
    a. ls : lists the directory contents
    b. -l : displays detailed information, including permissions
    c. -d : ensures only the directory's information is shown, not its contents.
