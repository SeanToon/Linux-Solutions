You have a new project starting, and five developers need accounts on the production server.
Explain how you would use useradd to create these accounts, assign them to a newly created 
devteam group using groupadd, and then set initial passwords. How would you confirm the 
accounts are set up correctly and ensure that the users have the appropriate default shells 
and home directories?

Steps: 

1. Create the group devteam
    command : groupadd devteam

2. Add users, create account, assign to group, create home directories, and set default shell
    command : useradd -m -g devteam -s /bin/bash username

3. Set initial passwords
    command : passwd username

4. Verify setup 
    command : id username

5. Confirm home directories
    command : ls -ld /home/username

6. Verify shell settings
    command : grep username /etc/passwd

7. Ensure appropriate permissions
    command :chmod

Explanation: 

  a. useradd -m -g devteam -s /bin/bash username 
      - -m : ensures home directory is created for the user
      - -g devteam : assigns the user to the devteam group as their primary group
      - -s /bin/bash : sets default shell to Bash
      - username : placeholder for developers username
