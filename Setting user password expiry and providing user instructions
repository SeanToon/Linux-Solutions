Your company's security guidelines require that all user passwords expire every 60 days. 
Describe how you would use Linux's password aging features (chage) to enforce this policy
on existing user accounts. How would you verify that the change took effect, and what 
steps would you provide to users to help them understand when and how to change their 
passwords?

Steps: 

1. Set maximum password age to 60 days for existing user account.
    command : chage -M 60 username 

2. Verify the change 
    command : chage -l username

3. Inform users via email or announcment that they need to change their passwords 
    before expiry. Provide clear instructions using the passwd command.
