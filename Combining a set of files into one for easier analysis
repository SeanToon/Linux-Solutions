You have a set of daily CSV files named sales-20240101.csv, sales-20240102.csv, and so on
that you want to combine into a single file all_sales_202401.csv for easier analysis. After
combining them into one large file, you need to split this large file into smaller 100MB
chunks to upload to a remote server with limited bandwidth. Explain how you would first 
concatenate the files using a linux command then use the split command to break the large
file into multiple parts. How would you name these smaller pieces, and how would the 
recipient recombine them?


Steps: 

1. Concatenate the daily CSV files into one
    command : cat sales-202401*.csv > all_sales_202401.csv

Explanation
    a. cat : reads and combines the content of files
    b. cat sales-202401* : wildcard matches similar files
    c. > : redirects output to new file

2. Split the combined file into 100MB chunks 
    command : split -b 100M all_sales_202401.csv all_sales_chunk_ 

Explanation
    a. split : command to divide files into smaller pieces
    b. -b 100M : specifies chunk size as 100MB
    c. all_sales_202401.csv : source file to split
    d. all_sales_chunk_: Prefix for generated files (all_sales_chunk_aa, all_sales_chunk_ab).

3. Recombine Chunks
    command : cat all_sales_chunk_* > all_sales_202401.csv

Explanation
    a. cat : combines files in lexicographical order. 
    b. all_sales_chunk_* : wildcard selects all split chunks in sequence.
    c. > : redirects output to recreate the original file

note : this is the suitable method for low bandwidth requirements!
