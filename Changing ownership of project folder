You have recently taken over a project folder /var/www/project that was previously 
maintained by another user. To ensure the new developer group webdev can manage these 
files going forward, you need to transfer ownership of all files from olduser to newuser
and assign the group to webdev. Describe the steps and commands (chown, chgrp) you would
use to achieve this. How would you confirm the changes?

Steps: 

1. Change ownership
    command : sudo chown -R webdev /var/www/project

2. Change group ownership
    command : sudo chgrp -R webdev /var/www/project

3. Confirm ownership changes:
    command : ls -l /var/www/project

Explanation
    a. -R option in both commands : ensures recursive application to all files/subdirectories 
    b. -l option displays detailed file info, including owner and group
