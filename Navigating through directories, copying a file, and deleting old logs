You are a Windows Admin who has just started working on a Linux server. Youre used to 
commands like dir, copy, and del in Windows, but now you need to learn Linux equivalents
(ls, cp, rm). Describe a common real-life scenario where you must navigate through directories
, copy a file, and delete an old log using Linux commands. Explain the Linux equivalents of 
the Windows commands you are familiar with and discuss any key differences in syntax or behavior
that a Windows user should keep in mind.

Steps:

1. Navigate to log file, backup server logs, then delete old logs. 
    command : cp /var/logs/server.log /backup/logs/ 
    then...
              rm /var/logs/old.log
