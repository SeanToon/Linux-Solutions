Your application has generated a log file with thousands of entries containing the old 
domain name oldsite.com, which needs to be replaced with newsite.com before you foward the
logs to a third party. Describe how you would use sed to perfom this find-and-replace operation 
directly on the file. Explain the command syntax, what each part means, and how you would 
verify the change without manually inspecting every line. 

Steps: 

1. Replace all instances of oldsite.com with newsite.com in a log file using the sed command
    command : sed -i 's/oldsite\.com/newsite\.com/g' logfile.log

Explanation
    a. sed command is useful for editing the file in place to make sure that no additional
       copies are created. (especially useful for large files)
    b. -i, edits file in place, directly modifying logfile.log
    c. for " s/oldsite\.com/newsite\.com/g' "
          - s : is the substitution command
          - oldsite\.com : the search pattern ( dot escaped to treat it as literal).
          - newsite\.com : the replacement text
          - g : global flag to replace all occurances in each line
          - logfile.log : target file containing logs
