Your companys security policy requires all developers to change their passwords every 90
days. Youve logged into the Linux server with your current credentials. Explain the 
command you would use to change your password, the prompts you would expect, and what best
practices you would follow to ensure a strong, secure password.

Steps

1. Change password after logging in
    command : passwd

Following prompts:
    Enter current password
    enter new password
    re-enter new password

2. Enforcing 90-day password policy
    command : vi /etc/login.defs

    Edit and set contents:
    PASS_MAX_DAYS   90
    PASS_MIN_DAYS   7
    PASS_WARN_AGE   14

    for existing users..
    command : sudo (if not root) chage -M 90 -m 7 -W 14 username

3. Verify!
    command : chage -l username
