You need to quickly determine the location of the nginx configuration file on a server
youve just inherited. The servers updatedb database is current. Explain how you would 
use the locate command to find all occurrences of nginx.conf on the system. How does 
this differ from find in terms of performance and reliability?

Steps:

1. Locate the nginx.conf file using the locate command
    command : locate nginx.conf

Explanation
    a. The locate command is faster than find because it relies on a pre-built index 
       of the filesystem created by the updatedb command. However, its results might    
       be outdated if the database hasnt been updated recently, while find searches 
       the filesystem in real-time, ensuring reliablility but at a slower speed.

Note: important to update "updatedb" before using locate command.
