A configuration file /etc/app/secure.conf must be accessible by the admin group for reading,
but should not be read by general users. The file's current permissions dont allow for 
this delicate seperation. Demonstrate how you would use setfacl to grant read access to the 
admin group specifically, while leaving the files primary ownership and permissions intact.
Show the commands to set and verify ACLs.

Steps:

1. Grant read access to the admin group using ACLs
    command : setfacl -m g:admin:r /etc/app/secure.conf

2. Verify the ACL 
    command : getfacl /etc/app/secure.conf

Explanation:
    a. setfacl : modifies the ACL of a file
    b. -m : option to specify modification mode
    c. g:admin:r : adds read (r) permission for the group admin to target file.
    d. getfacl : displays ACL for a file
