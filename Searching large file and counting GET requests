You want to search a large Apache log file for all GET requests on /api/v2/data and then 
count how many results you find. Show how you would combine grep with wc -l using a 
pipe to accomplish this. Explain the logic behind piping commands nad how this approach saves 
time compared to manually counting lines. 

Steps:

1. Search large log file for all GET commands 
    command : grep "GET /api/v2/data" apache_log_file.log | wc -l

Explanation:
  a. grep : outlines matching lines for all GET /api/v2/data in apache_log_file.log
  b. | : passes output of the grep command as input to next command
  c. wc -l : counts number of lines receieved from grep output, outputs total count 
      of matching requests.
