Your manager wants you to show the output of a lengthy script run, but you also need to 
monitor the script's progress in real-time. Explain how you would use the tee command to
display the scripts output on the screen while simultaneously writing it to a file named 
script_output.log. Provide the command and discuss a scenario where this might be useful, 
such as during a production deployment. 

Steps:

1. Display the ouput of lengthy script on the screen while writing it to a file
    command : ./your_script.sh | tee script_output.log

Explanation:
  a. ./your_script.sh : executes the script named your_script.sh
  b. | : pipe operator sends the output of ./your_script.sh as input to the next command
  c. tee : splits the input into two streams 
      - displays output on terminal for real-time monitoring
      - writes the output to file for later review
