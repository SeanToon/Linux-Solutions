You need to clean up log files from a directory that contain date stamps in their names,
such as access_log_20240101, access_log)20240102, and so on. How would you use wildcards 
to quickly list and remove only the logs that are older than a certain date?
Provide examples of the commmands and explain the pattern matching.

Steps:

1. Use the find command with the -name option for pattern matching.
    command : find /path/to/logs -type f -name "access_log_*" -mtime +30 -exec rm -f {} \;

Explanation
    a. find /path/to/logs : specifies the directory where logs are located. 
    b. -type f: Filters to include only files (not directories)
    c. -name "access_log_*": matches files with names starting with access_log_ followed 
        by any characters (*)
    d. -mtime +30 : selects files modified more than 30 days ago.
    e. -exec rm -f {} \; : executes rm -f to force-delete each matched file ({} is replaced
        with the filename).
