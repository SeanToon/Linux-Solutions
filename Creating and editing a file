Your team lead asks you to create a configuration file named app.conf inside 
/home/project/app/config/ and then add a few lines of text specifying database 
credentials. Demonstrate how you would create this file if it doesnt already exist, 
then open it in a text editor like vi, add the required content, and save it. What 
commands and key sequences would you use?

Steps:

1. Ensure the directory exists
    command : mkdir -p /home/projects/app/config/

Explanation
    a. Creates the directory structure /home/projects/app/config/ if it does not exist
       ensuring there are no errors due to missing directories.

2. Create and open file with vi
    command : vi /home/projects/app/config/app.confExplanation 

Explanation
    a. Opens app.conf for editing in the vi editor. If the file doesnt exists, it is
       created automatically.

3. Press i to enter insert mode and enter database credentials.
    command : (content to enter) 
        DB_HOST = localhost 
        DB_USER = root
        DB_PASS = secretpassword

        press esc to exit insert mode
        Save and exit with : :wq!
