Your team lead asks you to create a configuration file named app.conf inside 
/home/project/app/config/ and then add a few lines of text specifying database 
credentials. Demonstrate how you would create this file if it doesnt already exist, 
then open it in a text editor like vi, add the required content, and save it. What 
commands and key sequences would you use?
