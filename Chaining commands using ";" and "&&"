You need to run a series of maintenance tasks on a Linux server: first create a backup 
of a directory, then delete old temporary files, and finally print a summary of disk usage.
Explain how you would chain commands together using ; or && so that they run one after 
another. For example, how would you write a single command line to run tar to create a 
backup, rm to clear old temp files, and df -h to diplay disk usage? Discuss the differences
between using ; and && in this scenario.

Steps: 

1. Using ; 
    command : tar -czf backup.tar.gz /path/to/directory ; rm -rf /tmp/* ; df -h

Explanation
    a. tar -czf backup.tar.gz /path/to/directory : creates compressed backup 
    b. ; : seperates commands without dependency; next command runs regardless of success
       or failure.
    c. rm -rf /tmp/* : Recursively deletes all files in the /tmp directory. 
    d. df -h : displays human - readable disk usage summary.

2. Using &&
    commmand : tar -czf backup.tar.gz /path/to/directory && rm -rf /tmp/* && df -h

Explanation 
    a. same as before but with && each command only runs if the preceding one succeeds.
