You run a script ./deploy.sh to update your application, but it is failing silently. You
suspect errors are being printed to stderr. Describe how you would direct stderr to a file
named error_log.txt without affecting the normal script output. Provide the command and 
explain the purpose of 2> in this scenario. 

Steps:

1. Redirect stderr to a file named error_log.txt while keeping the normal script output
    unaffected.
    command : ./deploy.sh 2> error_log.txt

Explanation:
  a. ./deploy.sh : runs script deploy.sh from the current directory
  b. 2> : redirects stderr, identified by file descriptor 2 (standard error)
  c. error_log.txt : specifies destination file
